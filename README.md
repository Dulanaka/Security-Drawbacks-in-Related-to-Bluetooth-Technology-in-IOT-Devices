The main component of wireless  communication is Bluetooth technology. It provides a low  energy and affordable short-range radio solution. It is  available in mobile devices, headphones, speakers, medical  equipment, and many other devices. Today Bluetooth  technology integrated with IoT. In smart homes and  companies, the IoT based Bluetooth technology is also  available for monitoring and controlling the lighting,  thermostats, door lockers, appliances, safety systems and  cameras. But Bluetooth does not provide a centralized  security infrastructure for ease and convenience.  Therefore, there are significant vulnerabilities to safety and  the need to be conscious of security risks as technology  increases. With this review paper able to know value of  understanding the risks of attacks, Vulnerabilities,  mitigation techniques and recommendations involved in  our devices using Bluetooth technology.
